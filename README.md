Problem and context:
We live in a world with rising competition for AirBnB owners, as well as users having an overwhelmingly large choice of rentals. We want to figure out how various factors such as location, reviews, and population density affect the pricing of Airbnbs in Copenhagen.

Purpose:
We want to explore the Copenhagen AirBnB rental market as to figure out how an owner can properly price their property, along with potentially gaining insight into increasing profits. We also want to give the user an insight in the market of their chosen area in Copenhagen.

Research questions:

What affects the price of an owners AirBnB.

Can you increase profits from ones AirBnB.

Does the population density matter in terms of the price?

Does the population density increase the amount of AirBnbs?


Hypotheses: 

Placement, accomodations and facilities have a noticable influence on price.

Owners income can be increased by recalibrating their price to supply / demand

We think that reviews play a big role in terms of price.
