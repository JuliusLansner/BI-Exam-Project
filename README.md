# Problem and context:
We live in a world with rising competition for AirBnB owners, as well as users having an overwhelmingly large choice of rentals. We want to figure out how various factors such as location, reviews, and population density affect the pricing of Airbnbs in Copenhagen.

# Purpose:
We want to explore the Copenhagen AirBnB rental market as to figure out how an owner can properly price their property, along with potentially gaining insight into increasing profits. We also want to give the user an insight in the market of their chosen area in Copenhagen.

# Research questions:

What affects the price of an owners AirBnB.

Can you increase profits from ones AirBnB.

Does the population density matter in terms of the price?


# Hypotheses: 

Placement, accomodations and facilities have a noticable influence on price.


We think that reviews play a big role in terms of price.

We think that the population density increases the prices of AirBnB in the area


# Argumentation of choices:

We've chosen to work with a very large dataset and therefore our first task was cutting the data down to an appropriate size for our problem statement. Afterwards we explored the data both statistically and visually. We then continued further exploration through graphs, machine learning and algorithms.

We chose to use clustering and classification to search for patterns in our data aswell as relationships between variables. 
The Artificial Neural Network was chosen as a NN due to its potential for price prediction, compared to for instance a CNN.
We've created descision trees and chi square analysis to gain further knowledge as well as vectorization to create a recommender system.

# Outcomes:

## Placement, accomodations and facilities have a noticable influence on price.

    Our findings showed placement and accomodations having very large correlations with price, with placement being the biggest correlator to price range. We also found out that availability_365 is a very important feature for price correlation.

## We think that reviews play a big role in terms of price.

    We haven't found any evidence that reviews play a big role in the pricing of an AirBnB.

## We think that the population density increases the prices of AirBnB in the area

    We figured out that there is no correlation between the population density and price. NÃ¸rrebro as an example is highly populated, yet one of the cheaper areas.
